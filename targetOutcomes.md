For this article you should focus on the findings for Experiment 1 reported in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 2.2.1. Attractiveness judgements

> Consistent with our prediction, low SDRT faces were chosen above chance-level (50%; Fig. 2), both for female composites 91.38% [84.09, 98.67] Cohen’s dz = 1.463 and male composites, 63.79% [51.32, 76.27] Cohen’s dz = 0.28. In addition, low SDRT faces were rated as more attractive than high SDRT faces, both for female composites 1.67 [1.11, 2.22] Cohen’s dz = 0.78 and male composites 1.04 [0.5, 1.57] Cohen’s dz = 0.5 (Fig. 2).

> 2.2.2. Physical health and sex-typicality judgments

> For judgements of physical health, low SDRT faces were chosen above chance-level, both for female composites 76.29% [69.43, 83.16] Cohen’s dz = 0.99 and male composites, 66.81% [59.44, 74.18] Cohen’s dz = 0.59 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). In addition, low SDRT faces were rated as more physically healthy than high SDRT faces, both for female composites 0.59 [0.27, 0.92] Cohen’s dz = 0.47 and male composites 0.44 [0.18, 0.69] Cohen’s dz = 0.45 (Supplementary Fig. 1C).

> For sex-typicality judgments, low SDRT faces were chosen above chance-level for female composites 84.48% [75.08, 93.88] Cohen’s dz = 0.94, but not male composites 51.72% [38.75, 64.70] Cohen’s dz = 0.03 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). In addition, low SDRT faces were rated as more sex-typical than high SDRT faces for female composites 1.32 [0.73, 1.90] Cohen’s dz = 0.58, but not male composites 0.35 [−0.21, 0.92] Cohen’s dz = 0.16 (Supplementary Fig. 1C).
